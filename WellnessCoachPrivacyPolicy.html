  <section>
    <h2>Scope & Summary</h2>

      <p>WellnessCoach includes features such as onboarding goals, a home dashboard, mood tracking, AI chatbot guidance, breathing and meditation sessions (with optional AR overlays), reports/insights, gamification (badges), settings, notifications, and in-app purchases via Google Play. These features are reflected in our Android architecture using Jetpack Compose, Firebase Authentication/Firestore, optional Room cache, and calls to AI services.</p>

        <li><strong>Profile and preferences</strong>: your wellness goals chosen during onboarding and app settings (e.g., notifications).</li>
        <li><strong>Activity you log</strong>: mood selections (emoji + optional notes), session completions (e.g., breathing/meditation), streaks and badges.</li>

        <li><strong>Notifications data</strong>: device tokens needed to deliver reminders via Firebase Cloud Messaging/WorkManager.</li>
        <li><strong>Payments</strong>: in-app purchase status (VIP subscription) via Google Play Billing; we do not store your full payment card details.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional AR camera access</strong>: if you enable the AR mode, the app accesses your device camera to render overlays; no video is stored by default.</li>
