    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>TuneDetect</strong> is committed to protecting your privacy. This document explains how we handle data when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The application does not collect, store, or share any personal information such as name, email, account details, or location.</p>
    <p>When you use the song recognition feature, the app uses the microphone to record a short audio sample. This audio is sent directly to the <strong>ACRCloud</strong> server for analysis and song identification.</p>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>The recorded audio is used solely for the purpose of <strong>identifying songs</strong>. The application does not store, modify, or use this data for any other purpose.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
    <p>The application does not share data with any third parties other than <strong>ACRCloud</strong>, which is the service provider used for processing and identifying songs.</p>

    <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You may deny microphone access at any time. In that case, the song recognition feature will not function, but you can still use other parts of the application.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>TuneDetect does not store audio data on our servers or devices. All audio is sent directly to <strong>ACRCloud</strong> servers for processing.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>longhrk.dev@gmail.com</strong></p>
